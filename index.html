        <h1>AIR POLLUTION</h1>
        <p>The more our population grows, the more waste we produce. <br>
          A concerning form of waste is the toxic gases that we release<br>
          into the air. The largest toxic contributor is sulfur oxide. <br>
          The graph shows the amount of sulfer oxide emitted yearly.</p>
        <div id="airemissionchart"></div>
        <p>The toxic gases that we release are a result of our daily<br>
          daily acitvities. The graph below shows the contributors of<br>
          air pollution. Without porper addressing, air pollution will<br>
          affect the air quality that we breath and can also increase <br>
          surface temperature in some cases</p>

        <h1>DEFORESTATION</h1>
        <p>Growing population leads to acquiring more space for various <br>
          necessary purposes. As a result, more and more forests are being <br>
          cleared for space. The Chart below shows the amount of forest <br>
          loss that earth suffered. Measured in Hectare.</p>
        <div id="forestchart"></div>
        <p>Large amounts of forests are cleared, but what are the main drivers?<br>
          A substantial percentage of purposeful deforestations are caused<br>
          by humankind and their ever-growing population growth.<br>
          The main causes of purposeful deforestation are as follows:</p>

        <h1>WATER POLLUTION</h1>
        <p>As mentioned, a larger population equates to more waste produced.<br>
          The issue is that waste disposal is not treated with good practice.<br>
          A substantial amount of waste such as oil and plastics are dumped in<br>
          the ocean. As a result, many are left with no access to clean water.</p>
        <div id="nocleanwaterchart"></div>
        <p>The chart below explores the contributors of water pollution.<br>
          The result of all this contributors can endanger sealife and affect<br>
          clean accessible water. In some cases, the pollution can even release<br>
          toxic and greenhouse gases that affecs climate change.</p>

      <h1>CLIMATE CHANGE</h1>
      <h2>CONSEQUENCES</h2>
      <p>Despite the slow improvements on the degradation of environment<br>
        The effects of global warming has not diminished. Deforestation, <br>
        water and air pollution still contributes greatly to climate change <br>
        to this day. The world map shows the average recorded temperature <br>
        of each country. The global average temperature has <b style="color: rgb(255, 102, 72)">risen by 1.1°C </b><br>
        since 1880 and a small increase can have catastrophic results. <br>

        <h1>TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES</h1>
        <h2>OVER THE YEARS</h2>
        <p>In order to observe the impact of global warming, we measure the global <br>
          temperature anomaly through the years. A positive anomaly indicates that <br>
          the observed temperature was warmer than the average global temperature, <br>
          while a negative anomaly indicates that the observed temperature was cooler <br>
          than the average. From this graph, we can see that the anomalies are on <br>
          a steady increase which implies that the rate of global warming has increased.
